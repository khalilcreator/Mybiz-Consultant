If after that, you’re unhappy with the outcome or it’s taken us longer than 56 days to reach a solution, you have the right to take matters further. We work with a number of ombudsman and dispute resolution providers who will consider complaints about our range of service, products and financial services matters.

<h2 class="text-dark">The Ombudsmen Service: Energy</h2>
<p class="compain-p">
The Ombudsman is there to resolve disputes between energy suppliers and their customers. It’s a free service and they’re totally independent. That means they don’t take sides and their decisions are based only on the information they receive. You don’t have to accept their decision, but if you do, we’ll act on what they say. That might mean saying sorry, explaining what’s gone wrong, fixing the problem – or even paying you compensation.
</p>
<p class="compain-p">
On their <span class="text-success">website</span>, you can also find a factsheet, which gives you full details about their services and how they can help you.
